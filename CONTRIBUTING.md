## What is a "Complete" Project

A project is considered complete when:

1. It implements the minimum viable product for the idea
2. It includes a `README` with screenshots or a GIF describing the
   application's behavior. See [Freeze][freeze] or [VHS][vhs] for easy demos.

> [!NOTE]
> Please include an overview of what Charm libraries you used to build your project.
