# Strutt your stuff

This is your one-stop shop to find *incredible* community projects built with
the [Charm][charm] stack. Get inspired, and most importantly, get building!

This is an entirely community-driven repo for members of the community to share
their projects. You can PR your completed projects to be included in the list.

You're also welcome to contribute ideas without building them out.

## What is a "Complete" Project

A project is considered complete when:

1. It implements the minimum viable product for the idea
2. It includes a `README` with screenshots or a GIF describing the
   application's behavior. See [Freeze][freeze] or [VHS][vhs] for easy demos.

> [!NOTE]
> Please include an overview of what Charm libraries you used to build your project.
